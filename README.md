# Next Generation Loss (NGL)
This repository contains the code for the new loss function found by using the Genetic Programming (GP) approach. 

The full paper can be downloded [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12948).

# Example
The repository contains an example of how NGL can be used to train the InceptionV3 model on CIFAR-100 dataset. 

# Using NGL in your own project
The repository contains two implementations of the NGL loss: in pytorch and in tensorflow. Both versions can be used to train deep learning models for image classification. 

# Results
NGL was evaluated on seven datasets, which differed by the number of images, classes, by the type of images (grayscale and RGB), and their sizes.
