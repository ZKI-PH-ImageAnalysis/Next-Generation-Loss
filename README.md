# Next-Generation-Loss
This repository contains the code for the new loss function found by using the Genetic Programming (GP) approach.

# Example
There is an example of how NGL can be used to train the InceptionV3 model on CIFAR-100 dataset. 

# Using NGL in your own project
There are two implementations of the NGL loss: in pytorch and in tensorflow. Both versions can be used to train deep learning models for image classification.
