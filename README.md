# Example
The repository contains an example of how NGL can be used to train the InceptionV3 model on CIFAR-100 dataset. 

# Using NGL in your own project
The repository contains two implementations of the NGL loss: in pytorch and in tensorflow. Both versions can be used to train deep learning models for image classification.
